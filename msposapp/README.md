MS POS Cloud Service
------------------------

Teleflora Managed Services Linux Point of Sale Applications deployed in Amazon AWS.



Overview
------------------------

This solution provides for the Teleflora Managed Services Linux Point of Sale applications to run in the cloud on a single-host Docker environment with a 1:1 container to host ratio, in a private cloud network accessible by all branch locations of the customer. It will utilize as many of the existing, proven compliant, internal processes for delivering a Point of Sale system as possible. This application serves to manage those processes as well as a few additional ones from inserting the container layer. The end result will be a simple set of instructions (menu driven) to: Build, stage, and deploy a customer's Point of Sale server into the cloud, quickly, with no loss of data and minimal downtime.

Requirements
------------------------

- Very low cost.

- Minimal use of support time or resources.

- Automated build process.

- PA-DSS compliant.

- Minimal impact to other processes.

- Able to expand to a share-hosted style, or host multiple customers with one cloud account.

- Fast, repeatable, installation and configuration of Prod, QA, and Dev instances.

- Allow for ease to add other Teleflora POS Linux applications.

- Teleflora Managed Services Linux Cloud Backup Service.

- Minimal maintenance added to what is already done for the Point of Sale instance itself.

- Reporting; track use for billing, performance, and compliance purposes.

- Self-contained: The intention is to promote the conversion of physical Point of Sale machines to virtual. The POS servers need to be independant of each other. (An outage by one doesnt affect the many.)

- Ipsec VPN connection information for each remote location wanting to use this server.



Design
------------------------

The solution can be considered in 4 peices (Each having different compliance implications):

1. Build (media creation):

	An automated build process, using containers, to quickly produce OS media prepared with all the required components needed by the OS and application installation. Technically, the use of pre-prepared media from a marketplace, appstore, or other 3rd party, isn't recommended for PCI compliance. Additionally, in a catastrophic situation, quickly matching patch levels from a customer's physical server becomes a requirement.

  ```



3. Deployment (with or without data):

	Create VPN connection(s), shutdown application on physical server (if exists), run final backup to sync data (if exists), restore customer data, then start the application instance in the cloud.


  ```
	- Menu item: 112(create vpn), 5(restore data).

	SS NEEDED HERE
  ```


4. Reporting: 

	Creation of reporting sufficient enough to produce historical info for billing, performance, and compliance purposes.

	Examples: Yearly key rotations, periodic patch updates, instance inventory/subscriber list, or perhaps running time for a time-slice billing option.


The resulting container will be hardened, as well as address the gaps covered by the PCI references below. It will run the linux POS application in a container that is built with the same processes as the physical servers offered to the florists now. There will be a 1-to-1 container to host ratio to allow all host resources to be used by the point of sale application, as well as simplify the segregation of customer data per PA-DSS requirements. The point of sale instance will be connected by VPN connection to the florist's network(s), and route all traffic through the florist via that VPN tunnel (one VPN tunnel per remote location). Or "spoke and wheel" VPN configuration. This allows us to block all ports inbound to the container itself because we are using the POS application server as the VPN client, who ___initiates___ the connection(s).



Installation
------------------------

1. Launch a CentOS7 EC2 instance in AWS with the following configuration options:

	- A second network interface (eth1) assigned to the VM.
	- 100GB of disk space.
	- 2 Elastic IPs. Each assigned to each NIC. (One for the Docker host, one for the container.)
		- Leave the 1st NIC (eth0) an auto-assigned (DHCP) IP. 
		- Assign the 2nd NIC (eth1) an IP of 192.168.222.233/24.
	- Ports to be opened inbound to host (elastic bound to eth0): ssh (22).
	- Ports to be opened inbound to container (elastic bound to eth1): None (Block all inbound ___initiated___ connections).

2. Download and install cloud admin menus:

Login to the CentOS instance as centos; 

  ```
yum install git
git clone https://github.com/mykol71/MSCloudServer.git
cd MSCloudServer; sudo ./MENU; Select option "2 POS Cloud Serivce"

PCI/Security References
------------------------

In my opinion, the most important quote from any of these articles: 

>_"And while there are hurdles to be jumped and special attention that is needed when using containers in a cardholder data environment, there are no insurmountable obstacles to achieving PCI compliance."_ - Phil Dorzuk.

- Good Container/PCI article:

	https://thenewstack.io/containers-pose-different-operational-security-challenges-pci-compliance/

- Another, with downloadable container specific PA-DSS guide:

	https://blog.aquasec.com/why-container-security-matters-for-pci-compliant-organizations

- And, one more, that outlines the differences to address between PA-DSS Virtualization and Docker/containers:
